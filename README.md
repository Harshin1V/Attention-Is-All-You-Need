# Attention Is All You Need - Transformer Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model, as introduced in the landmark paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. The notebook demonstrates how the self-attention mechanism powers the Transformer architecture, leading to state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks.

## 📚 Project Overview
- Implemented from scratch using PyTorch.
- Explanation of core concepts like Multi-Head Self-Attention, Positional Encoding, and Feedforward Networks.
- Training a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) tasks.
- Visualization of attention maps to interpret model behavior.

## 🚀 Features
- Complete PyTorch implementation of Transformer model.
- Supports encoder-decoder architecture.
- Includes customizable hyperparameters for experimentation.
- Demonstrates data preprocessing and model training.

## 🧑‍💻 Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshin1V/Attention-Is-All-You-Need.git
cd Attention-Is-All-You-Need
```
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab:
